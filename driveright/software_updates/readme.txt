Simply extract all the files from the zip file. This download contains a .ppt file and 6 .swf files.

To make the animation effects in this template work correctly, any files with a .swf extension must be stored — and remain — in the same folder as your final presentation. For example, create a folder in My Documents, and then extract all files to that folder, and save any copies of the presentation that you create to the same folder.

Suggested Folder Structure:

My Documents
	your_presentation_folder 
		your_presentation.ppt
		animation_files.swf

In order for these templates to run properly, please check the system requirements below:

  A. In the computer control panel, choose “Add or Remove Programs”.

  B. Under Microsoft Office, choose “Change”

  C. Choose ‘Add or Remove” features.

  D. Under Office Shared Features, click “Visual Basic for Applications” and choose “Run from My Computer”

An animation will play when the presentation is in slide show view. If the animation does not play, please check the system requirements above.
