				<p>First,  decide on your set-up options as follows:</p>
			</div>
			<div id="bodycontent">
				<p>MPH or  KPH speed monitoring. Default is set for Miles Per Hour (MPH)</p>
                <p>PassCode to be used. Default is <span class="highlight">0000</span>.We strongly recommend that <em><u>another</u></em> PassCode be assigned.</p>

                <p>Maximum allowed speed. Default is set at 40 Mph.</p>
                <p>Speed  limit Enforcement or Monitoring only mode*. Default is set for Enforcement.</p>
              	<p>Length  of time (1 to 20 seconds) of <span class="highlight">O</span>ver<span class="highlight">S</span>peed violation before it is  logged in. Default is set for 10 seconds.</p>
                <p><span class="highlight">Sleep Mode**</span> </p></div>

				<div id="bodyheader">
				<p>Set-up and Control Procedures: </p>
			</div>
			<div id="bodycontent2">
				<p class="one">The SpeedSpy set-up and control is accomplished by use of 2 tactile switches (White Mode and Red Enter) and 2 seven segment displays located on the enclosure front panel.</p>
                <p class="two"> If the SpeedSpy has been disconnected for  more than 15 seconds, it will display P0 (the <span class="highlight">0</span>  will be flashing) when it is reconnected. This is the prompt to enter  the PassCode. It must be done within 15 seconds or a Tamper Detected (<span class="highlight">td</span>) will be registered. </p>

                <p>Initially,  you <span class="highlight">MUST</span> use the default PassCode of <span class="highlight">0000</span>  to get access to the set-up and control procedure. At this point we  suggest that you go to Mode 6 and enter your new PassCode (we recommend  that you not retain the default PassCode!).</p>
                <p>This is done by pressing the Enter and Mode switches at the same time  and releasing. The response is a Beep and the display of P0 with a  flashing <span class="highlight">0</span> (the  prompt to enter the <span class="highlight">P</span>ass<span class="highlight">C</span>ode) press Enter 4 times and the default <span class="highlight">P</span>ass<span class="highlight">C</span>ode of <span class="highlight">0000</span> will be entered. If an incorrect PassCode is entered,  the letters <span class="highlight">Er</span> for Error will be displayed. After 3 <span class="red"><u>incorrect</u></span> PassCode entries, a PassCode recovery code consisting of letters and  digits is displayed. This code can be sent to the manufacturer with  proof of product ownership and the correct <span class="highlight">P</span>ass<span class="highlight">C</span>ode can be recovered.</p>

              	<p> This is  the procedure for changing the PassCode: After the correct PassCode is entered, <span class="highlight">Cd</span> will briefly be displayed and then 3 horizontal lines and a flashing <span class="highlight">0</span>.  This is the prompt to select 1 of 8 (0 through 7) set-up Menus. Press  the Mode button until 6 is displayed and then press the Enter button a  flashing <span class="highlight">0</span> will again be displayed. To  change the PassCode to, for example, 0736, press the Enter button for 0  then the Mode button to get a 7 displayed then press the Enter button,  then press the Mode button to get the 3 displayed, etc. After all 4  digits have been entered they have to immediately be <u>re-entered</u> before  the new PassCode is accepted. This is to ensure that no error was made during  the entry.<br />
</p>
                <p class="three">Set-up Menu Modes:</p>

					<p class="bold">Mode 0  -&gt; Exit Set-up Mode.</p>	
					<p class="bold">Mode 1  -&gt; Show OverSpeed (<span class="highlight">OS</span>) count.***</p>
					<p class="bold">Mode 2  -&gt; Clear OverSpeed count and Tamper status.</p>
					<p class="bold">Mode 3  -&gt; Speed limit adjustment.</p>

					<p class="bold">Mode 4  -&gt; Mph/Kph selection <span class="highlight">On</span> = Mph/ <span class="highlight">Of</span> = Kph.</p>
					<p class="bold">Mode 5  -&gt; <span class="highlight">OverSpeed</span> timeout 1-20 seconds, <span class="highlight">0</span> = 8 second Monitor Mode<span class="red">*</span>.</p>

					<p class="bold">Mode 6  -&gt; Change PassCode.</p>
					<p class="bold">Mode 7  -&gt; Sleep Mode<span class="blue">**</span>.</p>
					<p></p>
                <p><span class="red">*</span>If Monitor Mode is selected, the <span class="blue">OverSpeed Buzzer</span> will sound for only 8 seconds or until the speed is reduced below the set allowed maximum. If the maximum allowed speed is again exceeded, the cycle will repeat. The <span class="highlight">OverSpeed counter</span> will still increment the violation count. The purpose for this feature is to simply remind the driver that a desired speed limit has been exceeded. In the Enforcement Mode, the Buzzer stays on for as long as the vehicle is driven at a speed that exceeds the maximum allowed.</p>

				<p><span class="blue">**</span>When this mode is selected SpeedSpy will enter “<span class="highlight">SLEEP</span>” mode 10 minutes after the engine is switched off. In this mode SpeedSpy uses very little battery power</p>
				<p><span class="green">***</span>This mode is  selected by pressing the Mode (White) button to display 1 and then pressing and  releasing the Enter button (Red). All Over Speed violations will be displayed  in sequence with the actual highest speed displayed after each violation count.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p><span class="red">NOTES:</span>
In “SLEEP” mode, SpeedSpy can require up to 1 minute to resume normal operation after the engine is started. This mode <span class="red">cannot</span> be entered if there are OverSpeed or Tamper incidents. They must first be <span class="red">cleared</span>.</p>

				<p></p>
				<p> SpeedSpy will feel warm to the touch, <u>this is normal</u>. It has been extensively tested at an ambient temperature of 125 degree F. If operated in the “SLEEP” Mode,  SpeedSpy will feel “<span class="blue">Cool</span>” to the touch. This is because it is consuming much less power.</p>
				<p> Speed limits can be set from 1 to 99 Mph/Kph. Higher speeds of 100 to 250 Mph/Kph in 10 Mph/Kph increments with the right most digit flashing can also be set. </p>
				<p>In the speed adjustment mode, holding the <span class="highlight"><i>Mode button</i></span> down will enable “Fast Forward” of the speed adjustment.</p>

				<p>The <span class="highlight">OverSpeed timeout</span> is a feature that lets the user determine for how long a period of time an OverSpeed violation can continue before a violation is logged. A maximum of 99 instances of violations can be recorded before the count cycles to 00.</p>
				<p>Use of  the clear <span class="highlight">O</span>ver<span class="highlight">S</span>peed count and Tamper status Mode will clear both and also extinguish the <span class="highlight">OS</span> and <span class="highlight">td</span> display.</p>

				<p>To display the number of OverSpeed violations (OS), Select mode 1 and press and release the red Enter button.</p>
				<p>If there are violations or Tampering, a low level “cricket” sound and <span class="highlight">OS</span> and/or <span class="highlight">td</span> display is produced when the vehicle ignition is turned off or the vehicle is not in motion.</p>
				<p>The set-up modes cannot be entered while the vehicle is in motion. This is a safety precaution. A cigarette lighter power connection cable is supplied as a standard accessory to enable convenient SpeedSpy set-up and data display <span class="highlight">ONLY</span>. It <span class="red">cannot</span> be used for normal operation. SpeedSpy must be plugged into the Data Link Connector (DLC) to function.</p>

				<p></p>
				<p><span class="red">NOTE:</span>
When using the cigarette lighter power connection cable, the PassCode must be entered <span class="red">2 times</span> to get access to the set-up and control procedure.</p>
				<p></p>
			 	<p>
The SpeedSpy can be moved from vehicle to vehicle without repeating the set-up procedure.</p>
