    </font><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It
    is recently known as one of the deadliest diseases known to man.&nbsp; 
    Generally, the life span average of a person inflected from the time the 
    disease was diagnosed until death is less than 2 years.&nbsp; The disease 
    strikes approximately 3,000 citizens in the United States every year; by 
    hardworking people who have labored to provide for their families, doing the 
    job that is keeping the United States running and a great place to live.&nbsp; 
    They worked for the U.S. military, in factories, at shipyards, in mines, as 
    pipefitters, engineers, as steel workers, as automechanics and many other 
    professions.&nbsp; They came home from work to their loved ones covered in 
    dirt and dust; content that they have a job and are providing for their 
    family.&nbsp; They are content that they put food on the table and a house 
    of their loved ones.&nbsp; Content that they are working for their families 
    to make a better life in this generation.</font> </span> </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    But what they didn't know is that they are slowly killing themselves while 
    they are working and also the one's they were working so hard to help, their 
    family, their loved ones.</span></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mesothelioma</b> is a 
    100% preventable disease; the only known cause is exposure to the deadly 
    mineral <b>asbestos</b>.&nbsp; It is caused by inhaling particles of dust as 
    asbestos degrades, slowly eating away at the lining of our lungs and thus 
    eventually developing into a deadly cancer.&nbsp; Dust that was carried home 
    on the clothes of the men who built this country, dust that was inhaled in 
    clouds of white powder, dust that was cleaned from the clothes by the wives 
    and children who supported their provider at home, dust that made a fortune 
    in blood money for the companies that produced it and dust that was packed 
    around the heating systems in houses, offices and schools.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sad to say the 
    effects of <b>asbestos</b> on the body were known to be deadly for years by the 
    companies who employed these workers and made hundred of millions if not 
    billions of dollars off their backs.&nbsp; But instead of making bold steps 
    to eradicate the problem and save the lives of thousands of their workers, 
    they choose to do nothing and continue to make a huge sum amount of profit 
    with a deadly product.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many have gone so far in hiding the truth 
    from their workers and their families.&nbsp; And because <b>Mesothelioma</b> has a 
    normal latency period (The time of exposure until the patient falls ill.) of 
    20 to 30 years, many got away with this.&nbsp; We are only now beginning to 
    see the full effects of the disease and experience the terrible outcry of 
    the people against those who put profits before human lives to a degree that 
    is simply unfathomable.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This subdomain in 
    this website is created to provide you with a relevant and up to date 
    information on the deadly disease <b>Mesothelioma</b>.&nbsp; We are striving to 
    provide the most complete overview of the disease and all aspects of it.&nbsp; 
    This includes general information on the disease, breaking news n the search 
    for a cure and perspective legislation designed to limit as well as news on 
    the subject that can provide important and in-depth Mesothelioma information 
    and a legal guide to help you with the complex legal issues involved with 
    <b>Mesothelioma</b>.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Asbestos</b> is the one 
    responsible for the number of side effects, which can cause anything from 
    discomfort to death.&nbsp; Asbestoris and pleural plaques can result from 
    exposure to asbestos and more notably so can mesothelioma, a deadly cancer 
    that can take many decades to develop but only a matter of months from the 
    onset of symptoms to kill.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mesothelioma</b> is a 
    deadly cancerous disease that is becoming more and more common.&nbsp; It 
    affects the mesothelial cells that make up the mesothelium-the outer lining 
    protecting the body's major organs such as heart, stomach and lungs.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Malignant 
    mesothelioma is a fatal disease cause by exposure to asbestos.&nbsp; 
    Mesothelioma does not manifest itself following asbestos exposure-the 
    average manifestation time is 35-40 years and in some cases can reach up to 
    50 years or later.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of 
    asbestos exposure, mesothelioma comes in three forms: <b>pleural mesothelioma</b>, 
    <b>peritoneal mesothelioma</b>, and <b>pericardial mesothelioma</b>.&nbsp; All three types 
    have a variety of symptoms.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many employers and 
    manufacturers of asbestos know about the dangers when they exposed employees&nbsp; 
    to this material.&nbsp; And now the effects of this exposure are coming to 
    light, these companies are being forced to pay.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the cure has 
    not yet been discovered to combat the painful and deadly effects of 
    Mesothelioma, there are many experts working hard day in and day out to 
    fight for higher survival rates. to save lives and to punish those who have 
    caused such irreparable damage to thousands of Americans.<br>
